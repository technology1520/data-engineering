## Overview
This project is an end-to-end data engineering solution built on Microsoft Azure to process, analyze, and visualize Olympic Games data. The project demonstrates the use of various Azure services for data ingestion, storage, processing, and analytics, aiming to provide insights into Olympic Games historical data.

## Architecture
The architecture of this project includes the following components:

- **Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested from a public Olympic dataset using Azure Data Factory.
- **Data Storage**: Raw data is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
- **Data Processing**: Azure Databricks is used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
- **Data Warehousing**: Processed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards for visualizing the insights.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics are used to monitor the pipeline and log errors.

## Features
- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Schedule data ingestion from multiple sources.
- **Scalable Data Processing**: Process large datasets using Spark on Azure Databricks.
- **Centralized Data Warehouse**: Store and manage data efficiently in Azure Synapse Analytics.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize key metrics and trends with Power BI.
- **End-to-End Monitoring**: Ensure reliability with comprehensive monitoring and logging.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory**: For orchestrating data ingestion and ETL processes.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For storing raw data and intermediate datasets.
- **Azure Databricks**: For scalable data processing and transformation.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For data warehousing and analytics.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Azure Monitor**: For pipeline monitoring and performance tracking.
- **Azure Log Analytics**: For logging and diagnostics.

## Data Pipeline
- **Ingestion**: Data is ingested using Azure Data Factory pipelines, which extract data from the source and load it into Azure Blob Storage.
- **Processing**: Azure Databricks processes the raw data, performing cleaning, transformations, and aggregations.
- **Storage**: The processed data is stored in Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying and analysis.
- **Visualization**: Power BI connects to Azure Synapse to visualize the data through interactive reports and dashboards.
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor and Log Analytics track pipeline performance and capture logs for troubleshooting.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription.
- Azure Storage account.
- Azure Data Factory instance.
- Azure Databricks workspace.
- Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
- Power BI account.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
